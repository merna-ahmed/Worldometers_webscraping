Project Title: Real-Time Population Data Collection Using Web Scraping
Overview:
In this project, I built an automated data collection script using Selenium in Python to scrape real-time global population statistics from Worldometer.
Objective:
To extract and log live population data such as:
Current World Population
Births Today
Deaths Today
Population Growth Today
Births This Year
Deaths This Year
Population Growth This Year
Approach:
I used Selenium to interact with and refresh the website every minute.
The script collected data continuously for 60 minutes.
Each data entry was time-stamped and saved into a structured CSV file for future analysis.
Why it matters:
This project demonstrates how web scraping can help data analysts automate data collection, saving time and effort, especially when working with live or frequently updated data sources.
